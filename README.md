### An ML-based RLF Prediction Algorithm to predict failures in a radio-link wireless communication channel<br/>
Stable and high-quality internet connectivity is mandatory to 5G mobile networks, but once something unexpected happens, the influence of the defect is quite severe. This is due to various weather-related phenomena that affect the performance of radio links like clouds, rain, snow etc. Thus correct radio link failure prediction is necessary to avoid such radio link failures.<br/>

The objective of this problem statement is to predict the occurrence of radio link failures in:
1. in the next day
2. in the following 5 days <br/>

A Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting model is built for the same. <br/>
